# Spot Topics
These topics are aliases to using the SPOT SDK through ROS topics.
These can be added to expand the ROS Noetic ros system, and can allow future projects to use these topics.

Please add to this new SPOT-ROS Noetic package to help further ros development for SPOT.

You can even port some older ROS melodic SPOT topics to here.
